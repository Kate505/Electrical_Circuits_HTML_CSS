      <h2 id="what">What is a Circuit?</h2>
      <p>Our daily life is surrounded by electrical circuits, these are present in homes, businesses and even in cell phones. <br><br>First, let's define the word circuit. A circuit is defined as a complete and closed path around which an electric current can circulate. It can also mean a system of electrical conductors and components that form such a path. Every time you flip a switch (in operation), you are completing a circuit and letting the electrical currents do their thing.</p>

      <h2 id="whatis">What is an electrical circuit?</h2>
      <p>An electrical circuit is a path or path through which an electrical current flows. The path can be closed (joined at both ends), making it a loop. A closed circuit makes the flow of electric current possible. It can also be an open circuit where the flow of electrons is cut off due to the trajectory breaking. An open circuit does not allow electrical current to flow. <br><br>An electrical circuit is simply an electrical network that is defined as the connection of two or more electrical or electronic components that allow generating, transporting and using electrical energy in order to transform it into another type of energy such as: heat energy (stove), light energy (bulb) or mechanical energy (motor). <br><br>All electrical and electronic circuits, regardless of their complexity, have three factors associated with them: Current, Voltage, and Resistance.</p>
      <p>In summary:<br><br><b>Circuit:</b> It is a closed route, for example a car circuit.<br><b>Electrical:</b> We refer to electrical energy or electricity.<br><br>Then the definition of <b>Electric Circuit</b>: It's the closed circuit that generates electricity or electric current.</p>

      <h2 id="versus">Differences between Electrical Circuits and Electronic Circuits</h2>
      <p>The difference between electrical and electronic circuits is not very clear. In general we can say that if a circuit contains semiconductors it is an Electronic Circuit. On the other hand, an Electric Circuit has a series of electrical elements or components such as resistors, inductors, capacitors and power supplies. These components are electrically connected to each other for the purpose of generating, transporting, or modifying electrical signals.</p>

      <h2>Analysis of an Electrical Circuit</h2>
      <img class="image3" src="img/foto.jpg">

      <p>Analyzing an electrical circuit consists of knowing the value of electrical quantities, usually voltage and current, at certain points in the circuit. From these, other quantities of interest such as power or resistance can be obtained. Electrical quantities can be obtained using measuring instruments if the circuit physically exists, or deduced theoretically from a set of laws applied to the electrical scheme that represents the real circuit. In the latter case we speak of theoretical analysis of circuits. The objective of the theoretical circuit analysis is to deduce voltage and current values ​​at each point of the circuit that are close to the values ​​that would be obtained if the symbols of the electrical diagram were replaced by real electrical components and we carried out the measurement.</p>

      <p>Through circuit analysis we can determine what a circuit is for, know what voltage values ​​exist at each point or what current flows through each element. We can also determine if a real circuit is working properly. In this case, a measurement of the magnitude must be made and compared with the value predicted by the theory.</p>
      <p>To carry out the theoretical analysis of a circuit it is necessary to know:</p>

      <ul class="b">
        <li>The mathematical relationship that exists between current and voltage at the terminals of each electrical component in the circuit. This relationship is called a mathematical model or characteristic equation.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The mathematical relationship that is derived from the way the components are connected, that is, the relationship that is derived from the topology of the circuit.</li>
